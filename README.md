# canvas-dot

A tiny thing, I've built in order to relax.

It's made with plain new JS.

## New Features

- Mouse drag to rotate the view.
- Mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- Touch drag to rotate the view.
- Pinch to zoom in and out on touch screens.
- Choose between several 3D models like sword, cube, sphere, star, pyramid, the new heart and knot.
- Points and lines are now rendered in proper depth order.
- Objects behind the camera are never rendered.

## Point Editor

Add `?edit` to the URL to enable the editor overlay. The editor lets you add new points, edit the selected point's position or color, and delete points from the list.
